      <li>
        Prepare the Meat Sauce:In a large skillet, brown the ground beef or
        Italian sausage over medium heat. Drain any excess fat.Add the chopped
        onion and minced garlic to the skillet and sauté until the onions are
        translucent. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, sugar, dried
        basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring
        occasionally. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the Cheese Layer: In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese
        and beaten egg. Mix until well blended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Assemble the Lasagna: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). In a 9x13-inch
        baking dish, spread a small amount of marinara sauce on the bottom to
        prevent sticking. Place three cooked lasagna noodles on top of the
        sauce. Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles.
        Sprinkle 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese over the ricotta layer.
        Spoon half of the meat sauce evenly over the mozzarella layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat the Layers: Add another layer of three lasagna noodles. Spread
        the remaining ricotta cheese mixture. Sprinkle 1 cup of shredded
        mozzarella cheese. Spoon the rest of the meat sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Final Layer: Place the final three lasagna noodles on top. Spread the
        remaining marinara sauce over the noodles. Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup
        of shredded mozzarella cheese. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake: Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil to prevent excessive
        browning and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve: Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or
        until the cheese is bubbly and golden. Allow the lasagna to cool for a
        few minutes before slicing and serving.
