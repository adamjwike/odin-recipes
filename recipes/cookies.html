    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons (28g) unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons (25g) granulated sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons (25g) brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>A pinch of salt</li>
      <li>1 egg yolk</li>
      <li>1/4 cup (30g) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons (20g) chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Melt the Butter: Place the 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter in a
        microwave-safe bowl. Microwave the butter in 10-second increments until
        it's fully melted. Be careful not to overheat it; you just want it to be
        melted, not boiling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add Sugars and Vanilla: Stir in the granulated sugar and brown sugar
        into the melted butter until well combined. Add the vanilla extract and
        a pinch of salt and mix again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the Egg Yolk: Separate the egg yolk from the egg white and add the
        yolk to the mixture. Mix thoroughly until it's well incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the Flour: Add the all-purpose flour and mix until you have a
        smooth cookie dough. It should be a thick, sticky consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fold in Chocolate Chips: Gently fold in the chocolate chips or any other
        mix-ins you prefer, like nuts or raisins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the Cookies: Divide the cookie dough into two equal portions and
        shape them into cookie rounds. Place them on a microwave-safe plate,
        leaving some space between them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Microwave the Cookies: Microwave the cookies on high for about 40-60
        seconds. Cooking times may vary depending on your microwave's wattage
        and desired cookie texture. Start with 40 seconds and check. The cookies
        should puff up slightly and become firm around the edges but still
        slightly soft in the center.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool and Enjoy: Carefully remove the plate from the microwave (it'll be
        hot) and let the cookies cool for a minute or two. They will continue to
        firm up as they cool. Then, enjoy your quick and easy microwave cookies!
